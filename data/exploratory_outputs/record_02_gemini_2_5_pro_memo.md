**INVESTMENT MEMORANDUM**

**1. Executive Summary**

**Date:** June 16, 2023
**Borrower:** Nasdaq, Inc. (“Nasdaq”)
**Transaction:** Amendment No. 2 to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, administered by Bank of America, N.A.
**Background:** Nasdaq is a Delaware corporation. This memo pertains to the second amendment of a credit agreement originally dated December 16, 2022.
**Purpose of Transaction:** The amendment modifies certain provisions of the existing credit agreement to facilitate Nasdaq's planned acquisition of Adenza Holdings, Inc. The primary change is an adjustment to the financial covenants to accommodate the increased leverage resulting from the acquisition.

**2. Investment Highlights & Risks**

**Investment Highlights:**
*   **Strategic Acquisition Support:** The amendment enables the borrower to pursue a significant strategic acquisition, which could enhance its long-term business profile and repayment capacity.
*   **Structured Deleveraging Plan:** The new covenant provides a clear, time-based deleveraging path, requiring the borrower to reduce its leverage ratio in steps over the ~2.5 years following the acquisition.
*   **Continued Covenant Protection:** While loosened, the leverage covenant remains in place, providing lenders with a key financial performance metric and a mechanism for recourse.

**Investment Risks:**
*   **Significantly Increased Leverage:** The amendment permits a substantial increase in the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio to 4.75x, heightening the company's credit risk profile in the near term.
*   **Acquisition Integration Risk:** The transaction's success is tied to the successful integration of Adenza Holdings, Inc. Any challenges in achieving synergies or expected financial performance could impair Nasdaq's ability to meet the deleveraging schedule.
*   **Future Re-Leveraging:** The agreement includes a provision for a "Subsequent Acquisition Holiday," which allows for another temporary increase in leverage for a future acquisition, potentially reintroducing risk after the initial deleveraging is complete.
