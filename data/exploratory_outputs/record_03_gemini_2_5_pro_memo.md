**INVESTMENT MEMO**

**1. Executive Summary**

*   **Date:** September 6, 2024
*   **Company Overview:** The Borrowers are a group of oilfield services companies, including existing borrowers Tercel Oilfield Products, Pride Energy Services, and Top-Co, operating under the parent Innovex Downhole Solutions, Inc.
*   **Deal Overview:** This Joinder Agreement adds three new entities—Innovex Downhole Solutions, LLC, Innovex International, Inc. (formerly Dril-Quip, Inc.), and TIW Corporation—as "New Borrowers" to an existing credit facility administered by PNC Bank.
*   **Background & Purpose:** The transaction is a direct result of the "Dril-Quip Merger," where Innovex merged with a subsidiary of Dril-Quip, Inc. The purpose of this agreement is to formally incorporate these newly acquired and reorganized entities into the existing "Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement," consolidating the debt obligations of the combined enterprise.

**2. Investment Highlights & Risks**

*   **Investment Highlights:**
    *   **Post-Merger Integration:** The joinder formally integrates the newly acquired entities into the existing credit facility, creating a unified borrowing group and collateral pool.
    *   **Expanded Security:** The addition of new borrowers and their assets, evidenced by requirements to deliver stock certificates and insurance endorsements, likely strengthens the security package for lenders.
    *   **Lender Support:** The execution of this agreement by the Agent (PNC Bank) demonstrates the existing lender group's consent and continued support for the company following the merger.

*   **Investment Risks:**
    *   **Incomplete Information:** The provided document is a joinder to a pre-existing credit agreement. Critical financial terms, including facility size, interest rate, maturity, and financial covenants, are not available, preventing a complete analysis.
    *   **Merger Integration Risk:** As this action stems from a recent merger, the combined entity faces typical integration risks, which could impact operational performance and the ability to service debt.
    *   **Post-Closing Obligations:** The borrowers must satisfy several time-sensitive post-closing covenants, such as delivering stock certificates and insurance documentation. Failure to comply could trigger a default.
