Investment Memo – Amendment No. 2 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Nasdaq, Inc.)

1) Executive Summary
- Date: June 16, 2023 (Amendment No. 2 Effective Date)
- Company: Nasdaq, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Borrower)
- Administrative Agent: Bank of America, N.A.
- What the deal is: Amendment No. 2 to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated December 16, 2022 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 on March 29, 2023).
- Background: The Borrower intends to consummate the acquisition (the “Specified Acquisition”) of Adenza Holdings, Inc. pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 10, 2023.
- Purpose of the transaction: Amend certain provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement, including introducing definitions related to the Specified Acquisition and modifying the Leverage Ratio covenant with a post-closing step-down schedule and a one-time “Subsequent Acquisition Holiday.”
- Effectiveness conditions: Executed counterparts from the Borrower, Administrative Agent, and Required Lenders; payment of reasonable and documented agent expenses (to the extent invoiced at least two business days prior). Borrower represents no Default and that representations/warranties are true and correct in all material respects as of the Effective Date.
- Other: Except as expressly set forth in the amendment, all terms of the Existing Credit Agreement remain in full force and effect. Governing law is New York.

2) Investment Highlights & Risks
Highlights
- Temporary covenant headroom post-acquisition: After the Specified Acquisition closing, maximum Leverage Ratio steps down over 10 fiscal quarters from 4.75x to 3.50x, providing integration flexibility.
- Future acquisition flexibility: One-time “Subsequent Acquisition Holiday” allows higher Leverage Ratio thresholds in connection with a subsequent Acquisition, subject to specified conditions and notice requirements.
- Compliance at effectiveness: Amendment effectiveness required no existing Default and reaffirmation of representations and warranties.
- Clarity of covenant framework: Detailed schedule and conditions for leverage limits and holiday, with reversion to 3.50x after the holiday (if applicable).

Risks
- Higher leverage tolerance post-closing: Permitted Leverage Ratio up to 4.75x immediately following the Specified Acquisition increases near-term credit risk until step-downs occur.
- Potential extended period of elevated leverage: The Subsequent Acquisition Holiday can raise permitted leverage for up to eight fiscal quarters in connection with another Acquisition, subject to conditions.
- Covenant compliance risk: Failure to meet step-down thresholds or holiday conditions (including required notice and pro forma tests) could result in covenant breaches.
