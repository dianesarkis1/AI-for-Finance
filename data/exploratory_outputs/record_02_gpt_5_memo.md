Investment Memo – Amendment No. 2 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement

1) Executive Summary
- Date: June 16, 2023 (Amendment No. 2 Effective Date)
- Company: Nasdaq, Inc. (Delaware corporation; “Borrower”)
- Transaction: Amendment No. 2 to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated December 16, 2022 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 on March 29, 2023). Administrative Agent: Bank of America, N.A.
- Background: Borrower intends to consummate the acquisition of Adenza Holdings, Inc. pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 10, 2023.
- Purpose: Amend Section 6.06 (Leverage Ratio covenant) to establish a post-acquisition step-down schedule and permit a one-time “Subsequent Acquisition Holiday,” subject to conditions. Conditions to effectiveness include executed counterparts by the Borrower, Administrative Agent and Required Lenders, and payment of specified invoiced expenses. The amendment is a “Loan Document” governed by New York law.

2) Investment Highlights & Risks
Highlights
- Acquisition-driven covenant flexibility: Defined maximum Leverage Ratio step-downs after the Specified Acquisition closing (4.75x to 3.50x over time).
- One-time Subsequent Acquisition Holiday: Temporarily higher maximum Leverage Ratio (4.50x, then 4.25x, 4.00x, 3.75x) for a future Acquisition, subject to (i) prior-quarter Leverage Ratio ≤3.50x, (ii) pro forma compliance at ≤4.50x at closing, (iii) written notice with transaction details; automatic reversion to 3.50x thereafter.
- Clarity and lender consent: Amendment executed among Borrower, Administrative Agent, and Required Lenders; references in Loan Documents updated accordingly.

Risks
- Higher permitted leverage: Up to 4.75x immediately post-Specified Acquisition closing increases near-term credit risk.
- Compliance risk: Failure to meet scheduled step-downs or holiday conditions/notice would breach Section 6.06.
- Limited flexibility: Only one Subsequent Acquisition Holiday permitted during the term; additional acquisitions may require further amendments.
- No broader waivers: Other terms and remedies under the Credit Agreement remain in full force; representations include no Default at effectiveness.
