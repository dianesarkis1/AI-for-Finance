The Borrower shall make each such election by giving the Administrative Agent written notice (i)&#8239;not later than 12:00 noon, Charlotte,

effective date of any conversion of Term SOFR Loans into Base Rate Loans and (iv)&#8239;not later than 12:00 noon, Charlotte, North Carolina
time at least five RFR Business Days before the day on which a proposed conversion or continuation of a RFR Loan denominated in a Foreign
Currency <font style="text-decoration: underline double; color: blue">(other than Canadian Dollars) </font>is to be effective. Each such
notice (each, a “<u>Notice of Conversion/Continuation</u>”) shall be irrevocable, shall be given in the form of <b>Exhibit&#8239;B-3
</b>and shall specify (x)&#8239;the date of such conversion or continuation (which shall be a Business Day), (y)&#8239;in the case of a

Conversion/Continuation with respect to a Daily Simple RFR Loan prior to the interest payment date therefor pursuant to <b>Section&#8239;2.8(c)</b>,
then, unless such RFR Loan is repaid as provided herein, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected that such RFR Loan shall automatically
be converted to an Base Rate Loan denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the applicable Foreign Currency)
as of such interest payment date. If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Notice of Conversion/Continuation with respect to a Eurocurrency
Rate Loan<font style="text-decoration: underline double; color: blue">, Term CORRA Loan</font> or a Term SOFR Loan prior to the end of
the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Eurocurrency Rate Loan<font style="text-decoration: underline double; color: blue">, Term

Eurocurrency Rate Loan<font style="text-decoration: underline double; color: blue">, Term CORRA Loan</font> or Term SOFR Loan, as applicable,
shall automatically be continued for an Interest Period of one month. If the Borrower requests a conversion to, or continuation of, a

to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.</font></p>

Administrative Agent will make available to each relevant Lender on the same date, by wire transfer of Same Day Funds, such Lender’s

amount of such payment owing to all of the relevant Lenders), and (ii)&#8239;if such payment is received after 1:00 p.m., Local Time, or
in other than Same Day Funds, the Administrative Agent will make available to each such Lender its ratable share of such payment by wire
transfer of Same Day Funds on the next succeeding Business Day (or in the case of uncollected funds, as soon as practicable after collected).
If the Administrative Agent shall not have made a required distribution to the appropriate Lenders as required hereinabove after receiving
a payment for the account of such Lenders, the Administrative Agent will pay to each such Lender, on demand, its ratable share of such
payment with interest thereon at the Overnight Rate for each day from the date such amount was required to be disbursed by the Administrative

Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,

Dollar Revolving Lenders, or (B)&nbsp;with respect to any Multicurrency Letter of Credit, the Required Multicurrency Revolving Lenders,
shall, require the Borrower to deliver to the Administrative Agent such additional amount of cash in Same Days Funds as is equal to 100%
of the aggregate Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit at any time outstanding for the account of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries (whether
or not any beneficiary under any Letter of Credit shall have drawn or be entitled at such time to draw thereunder) and (ii)&nbsp;in the
event of a prepayment under <b>Section&nbsp;2.6(b)</b>, the Administrative Agent will retain such amount as may then be required to be
retained, such amounts to be held by the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral account (the “<u>Cash Collateral Account</u>”).
The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender, the Dollar Revolving Lenders and the Multicurrency
Revolving Lenders, a Lien upon and security interest in the Cash Collateral Account and all amounts held therein from time to time as
security for Letter of Credit Exposure, and for application to the Borrower’s Reimbursement Obligations as and when the same shall
arise. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.

Borrower (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the determination as to investments shall be
made at the option and in the discretion of the Administrative Agent), amounts in the Cash Collateral Account shall not bear interest.
Interest and profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. In the event of a drawing, and subsequent payment
by the Issuing Lender, under any Letter of Credit at any time during which any amounts are held in the Cash Collateral Account, the Administrative
Agent will deliver to the Issuing Lender an amount equal to the Reimbursement Obligation created as a result of such payment (or, if the
amounts so held are less than such Reimbursement Obligation, all of such amounts) to reimburse the Issuing Lender therefor. Any amounts
remaining in the Cash Collateral Account (including interest) after the expiration of all Letters of Credit and reimbursement in full
of the Issuing Lender for all of its obligations thereunder shall be held by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Borrower
to be applied against the Obligations of the Borrower in such order and manner as the Administrative Agent may direct. If the Borrower
is required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant to <b>Section&nbsp;2.6(b)</b>, such amount (including interest), to the extent not applied
as aforesaid, shall be returned to the Borrower on demand; <u>provided</u> that, after giving effect to such return, (i)&nbsp;the Aggregate
Dollar Revolving Credit Exposure would not exceed the aggregate Dollar Revolving Commitments at such time, (ii)&nbsp;the Aggregate Multicurrency
Revolving Credit Exposure would not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Revolving Commitments at such time and (iii)&nbsp;no Default or

of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days
after all Events of Default have been waived.</font></p>

<u>provided further</u> that such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of <b>Section&nbsp;2.18 </b>as if it were an assignee
under <b>Section&nbsp;10.6(b)</b>.Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable

a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters
the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans
or other obligations under the Credit Documents (the “<u>Participant Register</u>”); <u>provided</u> that no Lender shall
have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information
relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Credit Document)
to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other
obligation is in registered form under Section&nbsp;5f.103-1(c)&nbsp;of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant
Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant
Register.</font></p>
