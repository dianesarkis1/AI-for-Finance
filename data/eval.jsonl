Capitalized terms used in this letter, but not defined in this letter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement.\nThis letter is to inform you that the Borrowers and Guarantors are in default of their obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents in that the Borrowers did not repay the Indebtedness by the Repayment Date as required by Section 7A of the Credit Agreement (the “Default”). Specific enumeration of the aforesaid Default shall not be construed as waiving any other defaults that may exist under the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents.\nNotwithstanding the Default, the Agent and Lenders continued to allow advances of the Revolving Credit after the Repayment Date to allow the Borrowers and Guarantors time to address the Defaults in consultation with the Lenders and Borrowers’ customers and to avoid disruption of the Customers’ production. Those efforts have been to no avail. Accordingly, as of the date of this letter, the Agent and Lenders will no longer allow automatic advances of the Revolving Credit. From and after March 23, 2023 any further advances of the Revolving Credit will be at the discretion of the Lenders and subject to such additional terms and conditions as may be required by the Lenders for any such advances of the Revolving Credit.\nUnique Fabricating NA, Inc. Unique-Intasco Canada, Inc., et. al March 23, 2023 Page 2\nUnique Fabricating NA, Inc.\nUnique-Intasco Canada, Inc., et. al\nMarch 23, 2023\nPage 2\nMoreover, as a result of the Default, the Agent and Lenders are entitled to, and reserve their rights to, pursue their rights and remedies available to them under the terms of the Loan Documents, at law or in equity to protect their interests, as determined by the Agent and Lenders in their sole discretion. Neither the Agent’s or Lenders’ enforcement of any particular right they may have under the Loan Documents, at law, or in equity, nor the timing of their enforcement of any particular right they may have under the Loan Documents at law or in equity, shall be construed or considered as a waiver by any of them of any of the other rights or remedies they may possess under the Loan Documents, at law, or in equity, or an election of remedies. All of the rights and remedies available to the Agent and Lenders under the Loan Documents, at law or in equity shall be cumulative and may be exercised separately, successively or concurrently at the sole discretion of the Agent and Lenders. Accordingly, the Agent and Lenders shall be free to invoke or pursue any right or remedy available to them at any time, including any time after having previously invoked a right or remedy available to them.\nNothing contained in this letter or in any other communication between the Agent or any Lender and the Borrowers or Guarantors shall be deemed to constitute or shall be construed as: (a) a waiver or release of any of the Agent’s or Lenders’ rights or remedies against the Borrowers or any person that is a party to the Loan Documents or pursuant to applicable law, (b) a course of dealing obligating the Lenders to provide any accommodations, financial or otherwise, to the Borrowers or Guarantors at any time, (c) a commitment or an agreement to make a commitment with respect to any possible restructure of the terms provided in the Loan Documents, or (d) having terminated, extinguished or discharged all or any portion of the Indebtedness due to the Lenders under the Loan Documents. Nothing contained in this letter shall confer on the Borrowers or any other person or entity any right to other or further notice or cure periods with respect to the existing Default. The Agent and Lenders hereby expressly reserve and preserve all of the rights and remedies they possess under the Loan Documents and applicable law.\nGovern your actions accordingly,\nVery truly yours, CITIZENS BANK, N.A. /s/ Michael Flynn Michael Flynn Senior Vice President\ncc: D.

We are writing to you in your capacity as Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this letter, terms defined in the Credit Agreement have the same meaning when used in this letter. The term “CAD CDOR Loans” in this letter shall mean loans that are borrowed in Canadian Dollars that use CDOR as an interest rate and the term “CAD Loans” in this letter shall mean loans that are borrowed in Canadian Dollars.\n1. Each Borrower acknowledges that Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Limited, as administrator of the CDOR rate, has announced that it will cease publication of all tenors of CDOR after the publication on June 28, 2024 (the “ 2024 CDOR Cessation ”).\n1. For good and valuable consideration, including delaying the incurrence of costs required to update the terms of the Credit Agreement in connection with the 2024 CDOR Cessation, and in lieu of amending or waiving any term of the Credit Agreement, each of the Borrowers agrees with effect from April 10, 2024 to suspend its following rights under the Credit Agreement:\na. Each of the Borrowers agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Credit Documents, from and after July 1, 2024, CAD CDOR Loans shall not be available under the Credit Agreement and no Lender shall be obligated to participate in any Borrowing under the Credit Agreement of CAD CDOR Loans (clause (a), the “Suspension of Rights”); and\na. Each of the Borrowers agrees that, if a notice or instruction is given under the Credit Agreement on or after June 28, 2024 that selects CDOR as the interest rate for a CAD Loan, such notice or instruction shall be deemed to be ineffective.\n1. The Suspension of Rights shall cease to have effect (and all rights of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement in respect of the terms set out in paragraph 3 above in effect immediately prior to the Suspension of Rights shall be in full force and effect) following notice from each of the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent, provided that, such notice shall only be effective if, prior to the date of such notice, amendments to the Credit Agreement to take account of the 2024 CDOR Cessation and to replace CDOR with a CORRA-based interest rate with respect to CAD Loans have become effective pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.\nExhibit 10.1 Execution Version\nExhibit 10.1\nExecution Version\n1. Each of the Borrowers agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each other Indemnified Party for any damage, loss, cost, liability, claim or reasonable expense whatsoever incurred (A) in connection with a breach or reasonably in anticipation of a potential breach, of any Borrower’s agreements in paragraph 3(a) or (B) giving effect to the instruction of any Borrower in paragraph 3(b) above, unless directly caused by such Indemnified Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final, non-appealable judgment of a court with competent jurisdiction.\n1. This letter is hereby designated as a Credit Document and we acknowledge that this letter will be posted to the Approved Electronic Platform established for Lenders for the Credit Agreement.
